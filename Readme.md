# PrettyUI

> The web world is changing so rapidly. New frameworks, libraries come out every week.. left, right and center. Lately, at work, I found myself writing less CSS than I thought. This is partly because, almost all the production level apps these days use Some sort of UI libraries i.e., Material UI, Chakra UI, React-Bootstrap and so on... I realized my CSS has gone little rustic becasue I'm more used to framework way of doing things.

### What this is repo is about?
